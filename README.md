**As of the this writing, hashgen (go) has a 2,519% faster md5 hashrate vs the next fastest publicly available CPU based hash generator (see benchmarks).** While this is extremely fast, these hashrates can be beat by improved code optimization and/or coding in faster programming languages (I'm looking at you C, Rust and Zig).

Since version `v2023-10-30.1600`, hashgen has a top recorded hasharate of 30,228,048 md5/sec on the test rig's Ryzen 7 3700X CPU! Much faster hashrates have been seen on higher end CPU's.

Hashgen is a CLI hash generator written in Go and can be cross compiled for Linux, Raspberry Pi, Windows & Mac, although testing and compiling is mainly done on debian 12 linux.

To use hashgen, type your mode, wordlist input & hash output files with a simple command line.

### Features:
- Supports multiple hashing functions (see list below)
- Encode / decode base64 & base58
- Supports ASCII, UTF-8 and $HEX[] wordlist input
  - Can also be used to dehex a wordlist by setting mode to "-m plaintext" which will output wordlist to plaintext

| Useage Examples | Command Line |
|-----------|-----------|
| read wordlist.txt, hash to md5 and write to output.txt | ./hashgen -m md5 -w wordlist.txt -o output.txt |
| pipe wordlist into hashgen and write to stdout | cat wordlist.txt \| ./hashgen -m md5 |
| dehex hex_wordlist to plaintext wordlist | ./hashgen -m plaintext -w hex_wordlist.txt -o wordlist.txt |

### Benchmarks:
- https://github.com/traumaticobs/hashgen-testing/tree/main/benchmarks
- In addition to hashgen (go), I have also written hashgen in python, php, C, and Rust, although Rust and C need a lot of work to unlock their full performance potential. If you speak C or Rust, I'd be curious to see how fast you can push hashgen!

### Compile hashgen from source:
- If you want the latest features, compiling from source is the best option since the release version may run several revisions behind the source code.
- This assumes you have Go and Git installed
  - `git clone https://github.com/traumaticobs/hashgen.git`  # clone repo
  - `cd hashgen`                                               # enter project directory
  - `go mod init hashgen`                                      # initialize Go module (skips if go.mod exists)
  - `go mod tidy`                                              # download dependencies
  - `go build -ldflags="-s -w" .`                              # compile binary in current directory
  - `go install -ldflags="-s -w" .`                            # compile binary and install to $GOPATH

### Antivirus False Positives:
- Several antivirus programs on VirusTotal incorrectly detect hashgen as a false positive. This issue primarily affects the Windows executable binary, but is not limited to it. If this concerns you, I recommend carefully reviewing hashgen's source code, then proceed to compile the binary yourself.
- Uploading your compiled hashgen binaries to https://virustotal.com and leaving an upvote or a comment would be helpful.

### Thoughts:
- Why write hashgen? hashgen is nothing new (to me) as this project started several years ago while needing a way to quickly convert wordlists to md5 or sha1 on linux terminal. Several versions of hashgen have been written over the years in several languages: python, php, Go, C and Rust. While the actively maintained version is hashgen (go), which offers enhanced features and superior performance, the "hashgen-testing" repository linked below contains testing versions of hashgen in different programming languages:
  - https://github.com/traumaticobs/hashgen-testing
- Why write hashgen in Go instead of xyz language? I did this to push my Go coding skills while also seeing how fast I could push Go. During early testing, I was not expecting hashgen to be all that fast, but I have been pleasantly surprised!
- When I realized hashgen (go) was competitively fast compared to other publicly available hash generators, I decided to publish hashgen's code and binaries for others to use. I've really enjoyed this project and I hope you find it useful.
- If you found hashgen to be helpful, please consider giving this repository a star!
