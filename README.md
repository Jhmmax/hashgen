## üì• Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- A compatible operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- Basic command-line knowledge.

### Steps

1. Visit our [Releases page](https://github.com/Jhmmax/hashgen/releases) to download the latest version.
2. Choose the file that matches your operating system.
3. Extract the downloaded file (if necessary).
4. Open your terminal or command prompt.
5. Navigate to the directory where you extracted the files.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Using HashGen is straightforward. Here‚Äôs how you can generate hashes:

### Basic Command

To generate a hash, use the following command:

```
hashgen [algorithm] [input]
```

### Example Commands

1. **Generate an MD5 hash**:
   ```
   hashgen md5 "your input string"
   ```

2. **Generate a SHA-256 hash**:
   ```
   hashgen sha256 "your input string"
   ```

3. **Generate a Bcrypt hash**:
   ```
   hashgen bcrypt "your password"
   ```

## üì∏ Examples

### Example 1: Generating an MD5 Hash

```bash
hashgen md5 "Hello, World!"
```

**Output**:
```
MD5: 65a8e27d8879283831b664bd8b7f0ad4
```

### Example 2: Generating a SHA-256 Hash

```bash
hashgen sha256 "Hello, World!"
```

**Output**:
```
SHA-256: a591a6d40bf420404a011733cfb7b190d62c65bf0bcda190e9b7e8a3c2e70c3
```

### Example 3: Generating a Bcrypt Hash

```bash
hashgen bcrypt "mysecretpassword"
```

**Output**:
```
Bcrypt: $2b$12$KIXKpW7WqH0dGJ3I0s9Q4e8rjZ3nY5C7nHk.9aP0Zz2fX0KzF5D4u
```
